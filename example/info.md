Graphs:

Organic networks from Cytoscape. 
Minimum spanning tree edges in red. Edge thickness proportional to genetic distance between nodes. 
Node colours show geographical origin (green = Aru Islands, blue = Bali, purple = West-Papua).
Node sizes are proportional to degree centrality (NetworkAnalyzer in Cytsoscape)
